# Advanced CSS: Sample Portfolio

## Description

This project entails building a developer's portfolio website tailored for potential employers. The website aims to provide
employers with a seamless means of evaluating the developer's qualifications and work samples.

## User Story

As an employer, I require access to a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples. This access will help me
assess whether they are a strong fit for an open position within the organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

To meet the employer's needs:

The portfolio must prominently display the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and clear navigation links to
sections covering information about the developer, their work, and contact details.

When clicking on any navigation link, the user interface should smoothly scroll to the corresponding section, ensuring a
user-friendly experience.

Clicking on the link that leads to the "Work" section should redirect to a segment featuring titled images of the
developer's applications. The first application's image should be larger in size compared to the others, emphasizing its
significance.

Clicking on any application image should promptly redirect the user to the deployed application, allowing them to explore
the developer's work in-depth.

The portfolio website should feature a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices,
ensuring accessibility and a pleasant user experience for all visitors.

By adhering to these acceptance criteria, this portfolio project will effectively showcase the developer's abilities while
offering an intuitive and engaging experience for potential employers.
